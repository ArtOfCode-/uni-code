Notice to Students
==================
I'm releasing this code publicly in good faith. You are welcome to use this code to further your own education in whatever way it can help (including "ew, why would anyone ever do *that*?!"). You are also welcome to use or modify this code as part of your own program, if that's helpful.

Furthermore, as the license notes, you are free to submit this code as your own assignment, providing the license terms are followed (namely: keep the copyright notices intact). Beware, however, that doing so is likely to earn you either severe penalties under your institution's plagiarism rules, or zero credit in the assignment because you didn't do any of the work yourself. You have been warned.
